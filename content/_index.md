# Yo doodz I am pro hacker Vidhu Kant

Yo. I'm Vidhu Kant. I'm a hobbyist web developer, and the self proclaimed CEO of Weeb Developerz.  
I sometimes make YouTube videos, though I haven't settled down on a theme yet.. My channel is called [MikunoNaka](https://youtube.mikunonaka.net)  
Web development somehow has become my main thing but really I just code whatever I like.  
I'm extremely efficient at picking up side projects, writing spaghetti code, and dropping the project after getting frustrated..  

# About Me

I like free (as in freedom) software, functional programming, customizing stuff and all the weeaboo garbage Japan can offer (instead of gacha games never get those)  
My "Company" Weeb Developerz was coined because I'm a weeb and a web developer so Weeb Developerz, the most hipster developer group.. 
though the only member seems to be me  
Apart from programming, I pick up new interests way too quickly and drop them at the same speed,
but there's still a long list of my hobbies that stick around. I hope I'd be able to talk about all of them on this website.
