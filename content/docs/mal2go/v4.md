description: GoLang API Wrapper for MyAnimeList's Official V2 API
summary: MAL2Go is an API wrapper for the official MyAnimeList V2 API written in Go.
---


This guide is for MAL2Go Version 4.0.1. It is not recommended to use former versions as they have a lot of bugs and missing features.

MAL2Go supports almost all of the functionality provided by the MyAnimeList API. Only working with the forums is not supported.
Everything else is supposed to properly work. If there is any bug please open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MikunoNaka/MAL2Go) or email me at [vidhukant@vidhukant.xyz](mailto:vidhukant@vidhukant.xyz). Forums support coming soon.

#### MAL2Go is divided into multiple packages that perform various API interactions.

- The [MAL2Go/anime](#mal2goanime) package is responsible for fetching information about an anime. It also handles things like searching, etc.
- The [MAL2Go/manga](#mal2gomanga) package is responsible for fetching information about a manga. It also handles things like searching, etc.
- The [MAL2Go/user](#mal2gouser) package can be used to fetch data about the currently logged-in user. Fetching another user's info is not allowed.
- The [MAL2Go/user/anime](#mal2gouseranime) package can fetch any user's anime list and update the currently logged-in user's anime list.
- The [MAL2Go/user/manga](#mal2gousermanga) package can fetch any user's manga list and update the currently logged-in user's manga list.
- Other packages are used by MAL2Go internally. If you want to develop MAL2Go, you can look more into them on the GitHub repo.

## MAL2Go/anime

This package implements the Anime struct and some methods to

1. Search for an anime
2. Get an anime's information
3. Get anime ranking list
4. Get seasonal anime list
5. Get suggested anime

### Setting up

How to use the anime package:

1. Install the anime package using this command

    ``` fish
    go get github.com/MikunoNaka/MAL2Go/v4/anime
    ```

2. Import and initialise the anime client. The client holds the authentication token of the user. The OAuth token should be set as "Bearer TOKEN". Refer to below example

    ``` go
    package main
    
    import (
        "github.com/MikunoNaka/MAL2Go/v4/anime"
    )
    
    func main() {
        authToken := "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
        myClient := anime.Client {
            AuthToken: "Bearer " + authToken,
        }
    }
    ```
    
Now we are ready to use the MAL2Go/anime package.

### Searching for an anime

Use the `SearchAnime` method to search for an anime. This method takes these arguments:

- `searchString string` Is pretty obvious. This term is used to search for an anime on MyAnimeList.
- `limit int` Is the max amount of search results to get. Max is 100.
- `offset int` Is the "offset" for the search results. If offset is greater than 0 the first n number of search reults will be ignored.
- `nsfw bool` Wether to include NSFW rated search results
- `fields []string` The fields to include in the search results. [Here]() is a list of the valid fields. Just using an empty slice (`[]string{}`) will include all the fields.  
The MyAnimeList API is picky about what fields to actually include with search results. To be sure that you are getting all the data it is recommended to use the [`GetAnimeById`](#get-data-about-an-anime) method which ensures that all the required fields are included.


Example:

``` go
package main

import (
    "github.com/MikunoNaka/MAL2Go/v4/anime"
    "log"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    authToken := "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
    myClient := anime.Client {
        AuthToken: "Bearer " + authToken,
    }
    
    searchString := "mushishi" // search for mushishi
    limit := 10 // get 10 search results
    offset := 0 // no offset
    searchNsfw := false // don't include NSFW results
    fields := []string{"title"} // only pull the title
    
    searchResults, err := myClient.SearchAnime(searchString, limit, offset, searchNsfw, fields)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err) // remember kids, always handle errors
    }
    
    // loop over the search results and print the title
    for _, anime := range searchResults {
        fmt.Println(anime.Title)
    }
}
```

### Get data about an anime

`GetAnimeById` takes in an anime's ID (which can be obtained using [`SearchAnime`](#searching-for-an-anime) or through the URL of the anime's page on MAL) and returns information about it. This method takes these arguments:

- `id int` The anime's ID
- `fields []string` The fields to include in the response. [Here]() is a list of the valid fields. Just using an empty slice (`[]string{}`) will include all the fields.

Example:

``` go
package main

import (
    "github.com/MikunoNaka/MAL2Go/v4/anime"
    "log"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    authToken := "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
    myClient := anime.Client {
        AuthToken: "Bearer " + authToken,
    }
    
    id := 457
    fields := []string{"title", "my_list_status", "num_episodes"}
    
    anime, err := myClient.GetAnimeById(id, fields)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err) // remember kids, always handle errors
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("You have watched %d out of %d episodes in %s. Your list status for %s is %s.\n", anime.MyListStatus.EpWatched, anime.NumEpisodes, anime.Title, anime.Title, anime.MyListStatus.Status)
}
```

Above example prints something like
`"You have watched 26 out of 26 episodes in Mushishi. Your list status for Mushishi is completed."`

### Getting an anime ranking list

`GetAnimeRanking` returns a list of animes sorted by their rank. It accepts these arguments:

- `rankingType string` Ranking type can be:
  + `all`
  + `airing`
  + `upcoming`
  + `tv`
  + `ova`
  + `movie`
  + `special`
  + `bypopularity`
  + `favorite`
- `limit int` Is the max amount of results to get. Max is 500.
- `offset int` Is the "offset" for results. If offset is greater than 0 the first n number of reults will be ignored.
- `nsfw bool` Wether to include NSFW rated results
- `fields []string` The fields to include in the results. [Here]() is a list of the valid fields. Just using an empty slice (`[]string{}`) will include all the fields. Again, to get some very specific fields, [`GetAnimeById`](#get-data-about-an-anime) is the most reliable option.

Example:

``` go
package main

import (
    "github.com/MikunoNaka/MAL2Go/v4/anime"
    "log"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    authToken := "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
    myClient := anime.Client {
        AuthToken: "Bearer " + authToken,
    }
    
    rankingType := "movie"
    limit, offset := 10, 0
    nsfw := true // include NSFW results
    fields := []string{"title"}
    
    ranking, err := myClient.GetAnimeRanking(rankingType, limit, offset, nsfw, fields)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err) // remember kids, always handle errors
    }
    
    for _, i := range ranking {
        fmt.Printf("#%d: %s\n", i.RankNum, i.Title)
    }
}
```

Above example prints the top 10 ranked anime movies on MyAnimeList.

### Getting seasonal anime

`GetSeasonalAnime` returns a list of animes that released in the specified season and year. Accepted arguments are:

- `year string` Is the max amount of search results to get. Max is 500.
- `season string` Is the "offset" for the search results. If offset is greater than 0 the first n number of search reults will be ignored.  
Possible seasons:
  + `winter`
  + `spring`
  + `summer`
  + `fall`
- `sort string` Wether to include NSFW rated search results  
Possible sorts:
  + `anime_score`
  + `anime_num_list_users`
- `limit int` Is the max amount of results to get. Max is 500.
- `offset int` Is the "offset" for results. If offset is greater than 0 the first n number of reults will be ignored.
- `nsfw bool` Wether to include NSFW rated results
- `fields []string` The fields to include in the results. [Here]() is a list of the valid fields. Just using an empty slice (`[]string{}`) will include all the fields. Again, to get some very specific fields, [`GetAnimeById`](#get-data-about-an-anime) is the most reliable option.

Example:

``` go
package main

import (
    "github.com/MikunoNaka/MAL2Go/v4/anime"
    "log"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    authToken := "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
    myClient := anime.Client {
        AuthToken: "Bearer " + authToken,
    }
    
    year := "2022"
    season := "spring"
    sort := "anime_num_list_users"
    limit, offset := 10, 0
    nsfw := true // include NSFW results
    fields := []string{"title"}
    
    seasonalAnimes, err := myClient.GetSeasonalAnime(year, season, sort, limit, offset, nsfw, fields)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err) // remember kids, always handle errors
    }
    
    fmt.Printf("Here are some popular animes from %s, %d\n", seasonalAnimes.Season.Name, seasonalAnimes.Season.Year)
    for _, i := range seasonalAnimes.Animes {
        fmt.Println(i.Title)
    }
}
```

Above example prints 10 animes from spring 2022 with the most users.

### Getting suggested anime

`GetSuggestedAnime` returns a list of animes suggested to the authenticated user.

- `limit int` Is the max amount of results to get. Max is 100.
- `offset int` Is the "offset" for results. If offset is greater than 0 the first n number of reults will be ignored.
- `nsfw bool` Wether to include NSFW rated results
- `fields []string` The fields to include in the results. [Here]() is a list of the valid fields. Just using an empty slice (`[]string{}`) will include all the fields. Again, to get some very specific fields, [`GetAnimeById`](#get-data-about-an-anime) is the most reliable option.

Example:

``` go
package main

import (
    "github.com/MikunoNaka/MAL2Go/v4/anime"
    "log"
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    authToken := "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
    myClient := anime.Client {
        AuthToken: "Bearer " + authToken,
    }
    
    limit, offset := 10, 0
    nsfw := true // include NSFW results
    fields := []string{"title"}
    
    suggestedAnimes, err := myClient.GetSuggestedAnime(limit, offset, nsfw, fields)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err) // remember kids, always handle errors
    }
    
    for _, i := range suggestedAnimes {
        fmt.Println(i.Title)
    }
}
```

Above example prints 10 animes suggested to the authenticated user.
