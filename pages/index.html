        <p>Yo. I'm Vidhu Kant. I'm a hobbyist web developer, and the self proclaimed CEO of Weeb Developerz.</p>
        <p>I sometimes make YouTube videos, though I haven't settled down on a theme yet.. My channel is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClA8PwtqRvBVkLI8xrdumxQ">MikunoNaka</a></p>
        <p>Web development somehow has become my main thing but really I just code whatever I like</p>

        <p>Some of my projects lie at <a href="https://weeb-developerz.xyz">weeb-developerz.xyz</a> (might not work rn) and my <a href="https://github.com/MikunoNaka">GitHub</a>.</p>
        <p>I love learning new languages and frameworks by creating small programs, you can check out my <a>Projects</a> which sort of acts like both a to-do list and a "dev blog" for the things I'm working on or planning to work on.</p>
        <p>Also check out "Project MACLI" which is a <em>group of projects</em> including a MyAnimeList API wrapper for GoLang (MAL2Go), an unofficial CLI-based MyAnimeList client (macli / coming soon) and a YouTube series tutorial for MAL2Go</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I like free (as in freedom) software, functional programming, customizing stuff and all the weeaboo garbage Japan can offer (instead of gacha games never get those)</p>
        <p>My "Company" Weeb Developerz was coined because I'm a weeb and a web developer so Weeb Developerz, the most hipster developer group.. though the only member seems to be me</p>
        <p>Apart from programming, I pick up new interests way too quickly and drop them at the same speed, but there's still a long list of my hobbies that stick around. I hope I'd be able to talk about all of them on this website.</p>

        <h1>MAL2Go: The MyAnimeList API Wrapper For GoLang</h1>
        <h2>"That time I created an API wrapper for MyAnimeList..."</h2>
        <p>
          MAL2Go is an easy-to-use MyAnimeList API wrapper written in Go. It can be used to access the official MyAnimeList V2 API.
          Currently it is mature enough to safely get and set information about an anime/the authenticated user's anime list.
        </p>
        <p>It has complete functionality to do the same with the manga section of MAL, but it hasn't been tested yet.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          MAL2Go is built for an upcoming MyAnimeList Unofficial CLI-Based client that is very based (macli).
          I'm not currently working on macli right now, first I will complete MAL2Go and the YouTube series and then macli will come into development.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want macli to release more quickly, please contribute to MAL2Go!
          Currently, all the methods associated with "manga", "user/manga" packages need to be tested if they are working as intended.
          Also, the "forums" packages needs to be worked on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have a YouTube series on MAL2Go, it only has an episode 0 explaining how to generate a Client ID, Auth Token to work with MAL2Go. 
          I have filmed other videos but they are yet to be released.
