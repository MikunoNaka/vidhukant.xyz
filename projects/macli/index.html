  <h1 class="centered-text">macli - Unofficial CLI-Based MyAnimeList Client</h1>
  <p class="centered-text">
    macli is an unofficial MyAnimeClient written in Go.<br/>
    It doesn't do much right now but it can handle logging in and
    updating some of the user's MyAnimeList data pretty smoothly.

      macli has an easy-to-use and interactive interface but most functions can also be used with flags to do things quicker, without the need of further user input.

  <h2 id="credits">Powered by MAL2Go</h2>
  <p>
    MAL2Go is a Go API-Wrapper for the official MyAnimeList V2 API. Do check out my other project, MAL2Go if you also want to programmatically access MyAnimeList using Go.<br/>
    Apart from that macli uses cobra and promptui libraries for the user interface. Big thanks to both of these projects.
