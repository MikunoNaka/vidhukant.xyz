  <h1 class="centered-text">macli - Unofficial CLI-Based MyAnimeList Client</h1>
  <p class="centered-text">
    macli is an unofficial MyAnimeClient written in Go.<br/>
    It doesn't do much right now but it can handle logging in and
    updating some of the user's MyAnimeList data pretty smoothly.

  <h2 id="installation">How To Install And Set Up</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        If you have Go installed on your system, simply run <code>go install github.com/MikunoNaka/macli@latest</code>
        to pull all the dependencies and build the app. This has been tested on Windows and Linux.<br/>
        An AUR package is also available as <code>macli-git</code>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Before running macli, you need to generate a MyAnimeList Client ID. Go to <a href="https://myanimelist.net/apiconfig">this page</a>
        and generate a new Client ID. You can set the name, homepage, etc to whatever you want (there really is no need to fill up the whole form for personal use)
        but you must set the "App Redirect Url" to "http://localhost:8000" (without the quotes) to be able to successfully login with macli.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Now, run <code>macli login</code> then paste in your newly generated Client ID when prompted.
        It should open a browser window prompting you to allow access to macli. Click allow and you're done!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Note: if the browser window doesn't show the MyAnimeList website but a blank page asking for your credentials,
        close that tab and verify that you have correctly pasted your Client ID. This usually happens when an incorrect Client ID is entered.
        You might need to wait for some time after generating a new Client ID for it to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: if you run <code>macli logout</code> to logout from macli, you can keep the Client ID saved on your system (when asked)
        so you can easily log back in without needing to enter your Client ID again.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="credits">Powered by MAL2Go</h2>
  <p>
    MAL2Go is a Go API-Wrapper for the official MyAnimeList V2 API. Do check out my other project, MAL2Go if you also want to programmatically access MyAnimeList using Go.<br/>
    Apart from that macli uses cobra and promptui libraries for the user interface. Big thanks to both of these projects.
